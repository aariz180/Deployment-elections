    -   **refactor**: Commits that rewrite/restructure your code without changing API behavior
    -   **perf**: Special refactor commits that improve performance

    **Style-related changes**

    -   **style**: Commits that don't affect the meaning (whitespace, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)

    -   Merging into the main branch (`master` or `develop`) should occur **once a week**, preferably on Fridays.
    -   Before merging, ensure that the code is tested and reviewed.
-   **Merge Requests**
    -   Create a merge request (MR) for any merge into the main branch.
